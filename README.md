# FitnessXpress
## User story
I created this app for a user to view, create and track daily workouts. A user wants to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. He should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, he should be able to track his distance traveled.
## Features
When the user loads the page, he is given the option to create a new workout or continue with their last workout. Existing workout summary is already displayed.

As a user selects continue workout, he is able to add a new exercise.

As a user hits complete the exercise is added to workout. Numbers are added to numbers on first image. As a user selects new workout, he is able to add exercise to that workout. In the first example it was resistance type, but here I select cardio.

As a user adds more exercises to this workout plan summary shows up at startup page. Note that id in URL is different.

A user is able to view the combined weight of multiple exercises and total duration of the past workouts on the stats page. There were just two workouts entered.

## Unexplained technical problem
As I wrote this code, I noticed that npm run seed shows unexplained error.

Index called name_1 sits somewhere in workouts collection, but I was not able to find where it came from. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88174852/146486794-55d823dd-1607-43c6-be7d-ef830b6c3466.png)

Instead of sitting on the couch all day, join me at Fitness Xpress gym in Sachse, TX, and record your workouts using my app.
